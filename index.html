      <h1 id="introduction">Hello, I'm Soumik Mitra</h1>
      <p>
        A passionate technologist who transforms ideas into elegant digital
        solutions. From web development to DevOps engineering and data analysis,
        I bridge the gap between code and creativity.
      </p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My path in technology began with a simple curiosity: how do
          applications work? That question led me through countless lines of
          code, late-night debugging sessions, and the thrill of solving complex
          problems. Today, I wear multiple hats - crafting responsive web
          experiences, orchestrating cloud infrastructures, and extracting
          meaningful insights from data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project I undertake is a new chapter in my story, where I blend
          technical expertise with creative problem-solving to deliver solutions
          that matter.
